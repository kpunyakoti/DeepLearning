Deep Learning practice

This Repository contains my Deep learning related practice exercises and projects (using pytorch).

Contents:

->Artificial NeuralNets using MultiLayer Perceptrons

->Recurrent NeuralNets(RNN) using LSTMs 

->Convolutional NeuralNets(CNN)

->Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs)
 
Projects:

1. Bike Sharing Predictions (MLP)
2. Dog Breed Classification (CNN)
3. TV Script Generation (RNN)
4. Faces Generation (GANs)
5. End-to-End project deployment on AWS
